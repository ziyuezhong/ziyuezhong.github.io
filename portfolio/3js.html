<p>
    This was one of the assignments in Computer Graphic course tought by <a href="http://hs.umt.edu/cs/facultyAndStaff/default.php?s=Johnson">Dr. Jesse Johnson</a>.
    in the assignment, we were asked to build a tree by using Three.js with the rotation function from 3.js library.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact-1" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it does?</h3>

<p>
  The big goal for this project is to practice how to do the rotation in 3.js. Also, in this project, we got a chance to get familiar with the syntax of javascript, and how to apply the texture to your model in 3.js.
</p>

  <a id="support-or-contact-1" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How you built it?
</h3>

<p>
  I start from the trunk part, which is a cylinder 3d graphic with different radius on each side. Then I wrote nested loops, for the first level, I loop from 0 to 4 which means the entire tree has 5 levels, for the second level, I loop from 0 to pow(4,i+1), pow(4,i+1) is the total number of branches the tree has on the current level,
   for the third level of the loop, I loop from 1 to 4 which means each branch (trunck) generate 4 branches for the next level. The 4 branches for the next level rotate -45 degrees on z direction, 45 degrees on z direction, -45 degrees on x direction and 45 degrees on x direction respectively.
   <br/><br/>
   After the model of the tree has been built, I applied texture to the model by using THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture function provided by 3.js. Also I have to use the command "--allow-file-access-from-files" to allow the browser to load the texture.
   <br/><br/>
   In the end, I attached an Icosahedron (which is also a assignment in this class) to each branch on the last level as the flower, and a green triangle geometry as the leaf.

  <a id="support-or-contact-1" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What did you learn?
</h3>

<p>
  In this assignment, I learned how to use the object.rotation attribute to rotate geometries in 3.js. Also I learned how to use THREE.ImageUtils.loadTexture which is a function provided by THREE.js to load the texture to the geometries.
